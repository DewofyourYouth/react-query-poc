# React Query POC

This is a proof-of-concept for refactoring our app to React Query. 

Comes with cache handling, devtools, and smart config defaults as well as a usable API.

## Requirements
To run the app you need MongoDB running locally on default port and obviously node running.
If you encounter issues running nodemon run `npm install -g nodemon`.

## To Start app
* clone the repository
* in the command line of the repo run `yarn install`
* `nodemon server/index.js`
* `yarn start`
